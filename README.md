There is a program that takes an age as input and determines whether you need to head to school or to college. But it doesn't work correctly. For example, a five-year-old child is sent off to college! It isn't difficult to fix the program: just put **curly braces** in the right place.

### Requirements:
* The program should read a number from the keyboard.
* The program must use the System.out.println() or System.out.print() command.
* If the age is less than 18 and greater than or equal to 6, you should display only "Off to school with you, my child".
* If the age is greater than or equal to 18, you should display only "Your college class starts soon".
* If the age is less than 6, then don't display anything.
